    <p class="maintext">The Pacific Northwest has always been known for its vast array of outdoor activities that are within driving distance of any major city.
    This also includes winter activities like snowboarding!! On a clear day, Mt.Hood can be seen from downtown Portland, OR. The 3 ski resorts on the mountain
    are just a 90 minute drive from the city. Mt. Bachelor is another amazing mountain destination that can be seen from Bend, OR. The ski resort there is just a short 30 minute
    drive from Bend and has some of the most fun terrain that you will find anywhere on the planet!!
