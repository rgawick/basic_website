        <p class="maintext">Mt. Hood Meadows offers some of the most spectacular skiing and snowboarding in the Northwest! The resort is close to Portland - just 90 minutes away - but delivers a big mountain experience you'd expect to travel much farther to enjoy. Mt. Hood Meadows Ski Resort operates on a special use permit on the Mt. Hood National Forest, and the resort sprawls across Mt. Hood's southeast flank, the sunny, wind-protected side of Mt. Hood. Meadows' playful terrain welcomes and challenges all levels of skiers and snowboarders. We have a huge mountain with terrain for everyone, magnificent views and snowfall beyond belief. Our entire staff is committed to providing you with a truly memorable and unique experience that is Mt. Hood Meadows.<br><br>

From the steeps of the front side bowls to the gentle slopes of our beginner runs, Mt. Hood Meadows terrain is known for its diversity and playfulness. Voted by Oregonians for having the best cruising intermediate terrain in the state, Meadows offers more than 2,150 acres of pure enjoyment. Rising to its highest lift-served elevation of 7,300 feet, you’ll feel like you’re on the top of the world as you take in a panoramic view to the east and south.<br><br>

Legendary Heather Canyon is like its own separate ski area - endlessly steep pitches of powder into the spectacular Canyon. There’s an additional 1,700 vertical feet for hikers who want to drop into the double blacks of Super Bowl above Heather, bringing the total vertical available in just one run to almost 4,500 feet.<br><br>

Access gates (experts only) provide extremely challenging, pulse-pounding gladed trails with cliff outcroppings. Those searching for the more open bowls of Elk and Yoda will be rewarded with epic runs and an experience you'll long remember and brag about. With 11 lifts, including five high-speed quads, the entire 2,150 acres of skiable terrain is easily accessed.<br><br>

This is a big mountain experience, with enough acreage to keep you busy for days and enough character so you will respect and remember your time on these trails. "It's so much bigger than what I thought," is a common reaction of those hitting the slopes for the first time, knowing that they'll need to come back several times before they fully experience all Meadows has to offer.</p>
