        <p class="maintext">With over 4,300 acres of lift-accessible terrain, you won’t want to pass up a trip to the ski resort with the highest skiable elevation in all of Oregon and Washington! Mt. Bachelor, located on the eastern flanks of Oregon’s Central Cascades, is known for its light, dry snow, diverse terrain, family-friendliness and long seasons.<br><br>

Bill Healy founded Mt. Bachelor Ski Area December 19, 1958 with a rope tow and a single lift. Mt. Bachelor has since grown to be one of the largest ski resorts in the U.S. The resort boasts a wide variety of terrain. Guests can ski or ride 360 degrees off the summit, hike the adjoining cinder cone for a thrilling run down, or, ski the trees to find that great cache of powder!<br><br>

Not only is Mt. Bachelor a great place for expert skiers and riders to get that burn, it is also a fantastic place to learn a snow sport or take the family for an exciting day out. Carrousel, our free beginner's lift, offers an easy ride up and gentle slope down. There are also numerous lesson packages to choose from; check out our link to snow sports services.<br><br>

Conveniently located just 22 miles west of Bend, Mt. Bachelor’s season is one of the longest in the Northwest, usually starting in November by Thanksgiving and lasting well into May. Surrounded by the tall hemlocks and pines of the Deschutes National Forest and breathtaking views of the Three Sisters and other Cascade peaks, you are sure to enjoy that mountain experience you seek at Mt. Bachelor!</p>
